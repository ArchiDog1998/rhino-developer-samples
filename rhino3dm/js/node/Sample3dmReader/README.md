# Simple 3dm file reader

An example cli tool that reads a 3dm file and prints some stuff about it!

```commandline
$ npm install
$ node index.js <path_to_file.3dm>
```

If you've cloned this repo, you should have some files in the rhino3dm/models directory and the following would reference a file from there:

```commandline
$ node index.js ../../../models/RectifiedArchimedeanSolids8.3dm
```
